# YGO-DOTR-Text-Editor

Requires Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses NTSC-U / USA.

Overwrites ISO, so make copies before opening!

How to use:
- Open a YGO DOTR NTSC-U ISO with "Open ISO" on the top menu bar.
- Either scroll through indexes or use the dropdowns to jump to specific sections of the game text and make desired edits.
- The "Clear Tutorial Strings" button removes all tutorial text, giving you a lot more space for adding text elsewhere.
- The "Reset" button resets the current viewed text to the initial value read from the ISO. The "Reset All" button will undo all changes you've made so far on all text.
- You can export game text to a tab-delimited .tsv file for easier mass editing with "Export to TSV" on the top menu bar. After making changes to the TSV, re-import it with "Import from TSV".
- "Save to ISO" will compile and compress all text and check the size of the result. If it fits in the ISO, it will save to the opened ISO. If it is too large, it will show a warning and will not save.
